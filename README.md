# Same Country, Different Plates

By Kylie Clifton

## Description

This project explores food access disparities in America—who struggles to reach a grocery store and why. Using data from the USDA, I examined how food insecurity rates differ by race and how vehicle access affects people's ability to get fresh food.

## Findings

- Black households experience food insecurity at 21%, nearly four times higher than Asian households (5.4%)
- 17.4 million Americans with cars still live far from grocery stores
- Having a vehicle doesn't solve the problem when there's no store nearby to drive to

## Data Collection

Data was collected from the following sources:
- [USDA Economic Research Service](https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food-nutrition-assistance/food-security-in-the-u-s/) - Food insecurity rates by race (2016-2021)
- [USDA Food Access Research Atlas](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-access-research-atlas/) - Food desert statistics and vehicle access data (2019)
- [Annie E. Casey Foundation](https://www.aecf.org/blog/food-deserts-in-america) - Additional food desert statistics

## Data Analysis

Analysis was done in a Jupyter notebook using Python and pandas. I compiled statistics from USDA reports and calculated comparisons between demographic groups. Charts were created using DataWrapper.

See `analysis.ipynb` for the full analysis.

## New Skills & Growth

- First time building a data-driven story from scratch
- Learned to use DataWrapper for creating accessible, embeddable charts
- Practiced writing data journalism that weaves statistics into narrative

## Future Work

With more time, I would:
- Download the full USDA Food Access Research Atlas dataset and create a map visualization
- Look at trends over time to see if food access has improved or worsened
- Break down the data by state to find regional patterns
- Interview community members affected by food access issues
